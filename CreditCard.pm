=head1 NAME

C<Business::CreditCard> - Validate/generate credit card checksums/names

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Business::CreditCard;
 
    print validate("5276 4400 6542 1319");
    print cardtype("5276 4400 6542 1319");
    print generate_last_digit("5276 4400 6542 131");

Business::CreditCard is available at a CPAN site near you.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These subroutines tell you whether a credit card number is
self-consistent -- whether the last digit of the number is a valid
checksum for the preceding digits.  

The validate() subroutine returns 1 if the card number provided passes
the checksum test, and 0 otherwise.

The cardtype() subroutine returns a string containing the type of
card: "MasterCard", "VISA", and so on.  My list is not complete;
I welcome additions.

The generate_last_digit() subroutine computes and returns the last
digit of the card given the preceding digits.  With a 16-digit card,
you provide the first 15 digits; the subroutine returns the sixteenth.

This module does I<not> tell you whether the number is on an actual
card, only whether it might conceivably be on a real card.  To verify
whether a card is real, or whether it's been stolen, or what its
balance is, you need a Merchant ID, which gives you access to credit
card databases.  The Perl Journal (http://tpj.com/tpj) has
a Merchant ID so that I can accept MasterCard and VISA payments; it
comes with the little pushbutton/slide-your-card-through device you've
seen in restaurants and stores.  That device calculates the checksum
for you, so I don't actually use this module.

These subroutines will also work if you provide the arguments
as numbers instead of strings, e.g. C<validate(5276440065421319)>.
