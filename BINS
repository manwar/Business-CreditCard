# According to a booklet I have from Westpac (an Aussie bank), a card number
# starting with 5610 or 56022[1-5] is a BankCard
# BankCards have exactly 16 digits.

# from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_number#Prefixes
# As of November 8, 2004, MasterCard and Diner's club formed an alliance.
# Cards issued in Canada and the USA start with 55 and are treated as
# MasterCards worldwide. International cards use the 36 prefix and are
# treated as mastercards in Canada and the US, but are treated as Diner's
# Club cards elsewhere. Diner's club international's website makes no
# reference to old 38 prefix numbers, and they can be presumed reissued under
# the 55 or 36 BIN prefix.
#
# Effective October 1, 2006, the Discover Network will activate new Issuer
# Identification Numbers (IINs) to support a variety of card types and
# products. Additionally, Discover and China Union Pay (CUP) have
# established a strategic alliance and reciprocity agreement. As a result,
# IIN ranges from CUP will be enabled to facilitate the acceptance of CUP
# credit Cards on the Discover Network by October 1, 2006. CUP credit
# cards will be enabled on Discover Network with a 16-digit Card Number
# only. The updated IIN table is shown below.
# 
# Minimum IIN             Maximum IIN             Product
# 650000          650099          Consumer Debit

# Please ensure that your POS terminals, websites and any pertinent
# internal systems can accept these new IINs.
